MoneyWeb (Sasha Planting) reports
- 1 million university students in SA 
- roughly 300K are first year students
- Finding affordable accommodation near institution as difficult as 
getting accepted
- shortfall of 300K - 500k beds and is likely to increase as a result of 
free education
- Universities’ residence facilities to accommodate out-of-town students 
are woefully inadequate. Stellenbosch University has 31 000 students, 
but 6 500 residence beds. The University of Johannesburg has 50 000 students 
but 19 000 beds spread between residences and accredited private 
accommodation. It is a similar story at other city universities.

Student accommodation is a subsector that requires a strong management team
and is not for the faint-hearted or inexperienced.
